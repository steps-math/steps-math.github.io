# Lecture: Derivatives as Limits â€” The Algebraic Definition

## Objective
To introduce the **formal definition of the derivative** using limits, and apply it to compute derivatives of well-known functions. This builds on the intuition of average and instantaneous rate of change.

---

## Motivation Review: From Average to Instantaneous

Recall from our last lecture:

- The **average rate of change** between two points on a function:

  $$
  \text{Average Rate} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
  $$

- As $h \to 0$, we approach the **instantaneous rate of change**, or the **derivative**:

  $$
  f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
  $$

This is called the **difference quotient**. It's the heart of differential calculus.

---

## Algebraic Definition of the Derivative

> Let $f(x)$ be a function. The **derivative** of $f$ at a point $x$ is:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

If this limit exists, $f$ is said to be **differentiable** at $x$.

This limit represents the **slope of the tangent line** to the graph of $f$ at $x$.

---

## Step-by-Step Example: $f(x) = x^2$

Let us compute $f'(x)$ using the limit definition:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}
$$

Expand:

$$
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh + h^2}{h}
$$

$$
= \lim_{h \to 0} (2x + h) = 2x
$$

So, $f'(x) = 2x$. 

---

## Another Example: $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{x + h} - \frac{1}{x}}{h}
$$

Use common denominator:

$$
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{x - (x + h)}{x(x + h)}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{-h}{hx(x + h)}
$$

Cancel $h$:

$$
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{-1}{x(x + h)} = -\frac{1}{x^2}
$$

So, $f'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}$ 

---

## Additional Examples

 1. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{x + h} - \sqrt{x}}{h}
$$

Multiply by the conjugate:

$$
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x + h - x}{h(\sqrt{x + h} + \sqrt{x})} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x + h} + \sqrt{x}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}
$$

 2. $f(x) = |x|$

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|x + h| - |x|}{h}
$$

This limit does **not exist** at $x = 0$. So $f(x) = |x|$ is **not differentiable** at $x = 0$.

$$

- (b) Graph it and explain why the derivative does or does not exist at certain points.

### 5. **Pointwise Derivative of a Nowhere-Differentiable Function**

$$

## Wrap-Up

- Derivatives measure **instantaneous change**, defined using limits  
- The limit definition is foundational, even if we later use rules to shortcut the process  
- Not all functions are differentiable everywhere (e.g., piecewise, absolute value, radicals at zero)
